reactor
=======

I am implementing my 4th version of the reactor pattern.
This stuff is going to be a base of one (or more) major software projects.

I am doing this in my freetime so this is free to play with.

My previous reactors were made in a rush so they are overcomplicated (and overtemplated). I want to make simple but
generic code which is reusable.

No screenshot this time :)
