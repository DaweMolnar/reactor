reactor
=======

I am implementing my second (or third) version of the reactor pattern. The implementation will be extended by threading
forming a leader followers reactor. This stuff is going to be a base of one (or more) major software projects.

I am doing this in my freetime so this is free to play with.

My first (and second) reactors were made in a rush so they are overcomplicated (and overtemplated). I want to make simple but
generic code which is reusable.

I hate comments. I think identifier names have to be self descriptive.

No screenshot this time :)
